<h3>Information You Give Us</h3>

Such information may include your name, shipping address, billing address, e-mail address, phone number, credit card number, shopping interests and preferences, transaction history, and other personal data (“Personal Information”). We collect Personal Information that is reasonably necessary to comply with your requests and with our legitimate business interests.

For example, like many websites, we use “cookies” and “clear gifs” to obtain certain types of information when your web browser accesses one of our Sites, or when you are provided the opportunity to complete surveys, participate in a sweepstakes or other incentives, or open or respond to any newsletter or other e-mail you may have requested.</p>
<p>Examples of the information we collect and analyze in this manner include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; computer and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system, and platform; your behavior on our Sites and related services, including the products you view or searched for, as well as the URL you come from and go to next (whether this URL is on our site or not). </p>
<p>You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to participate in our surveys or incentives, purchase products, or take advantage of certain useful Site features.</p>

<h3>HOW WE USE PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
<p>Information about Site users is an important part of our business and we take steps to maintain the privacy and security of such information against unauthorized access.

By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be required to disclose personal information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.</p>

<h3>HOW SECURE IS INFORMATION ABOUT ME?</h3>
<p>We have reasonable security measures in place to protect against loss, misuse and alteration of your information under our control.
