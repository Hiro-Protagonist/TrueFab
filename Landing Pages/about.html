<h3 style="font-size: 2em; line-height: 45px; text-align: center">About True Fabrications</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center">True Fabrications was founded in 2003 by a trio of college buddies who couldn’t find a wine bag. In the space of decade, the company that began with a single humble wine bag of its own has grown to a line of thousands of products spanning every sector of the beverage industry. Apparently, those three friends weren’t the only ones looking for better drink accessories.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Today True Fabrications is the leading designer and supplier of beverage lifestyle accessories worldwide. From our headquarters in Seattle, Washington we offer the very best on-trend products and branding at the best prices on the market. Our company is anchored by an innovative, future-driven product development team, cutting-edge in-house design and customization departments, sales representatives specialized in everything from national grocery chains to family-owned wineries, and the finest customer service team in the industry. </p>
<p style="text-align: center">To top it all off, everything we do is backed by our <strong>100% Satisfaction Guarantee</strong>. We hope you’ll become one of our thousands of loyal customers, and we look forward to building a thriving, long-lasting relationship with you and your business.
