<h3>Cookies

<p>We
receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact

when your Web browser accesses one of our Sites, or when you are
provided the opportunity to complete surveys, participate in a
sweepstakes or other incentives, or open or respond to any e-mail
transmissions for us.</p>

<p>Briefly,
"cookies" are small files that we transfer to your
computer's hard drive or your web browser memory to enable our
systems to recognize your browser and to provide convenience and
other features to you, such as recognizing you as an existing
customer or previous Site visitor. "Clear gifs" are tiny
graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies,
and may be used to track the online movements of web users or to let
us know if you have opened an e-mail that we sent you.</p>

of the information we collect and analyze in this manner include the
Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the
Internet; computer and connection information such as browser type
and version, operating system, and platform; your behavior on our
Sites and related services, including the products you view or
searched for, as well as the URL you come from and go to next

that we use do not contain and are not tied to personally
identifiable information about you.</p>

<p>You
are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits,
although in that case you may not be able to participate in our
surveys or incentives, purchase products, or take advantage of
certain useful features of the Sites.</p>
