  <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <h3>Okay, I've braced myself - What are your minimums?</h3>
  <p>True has no minimum order requirements</p>

  <h3>No minimumns?  Really?</h3>
  <p>Really!  No minimums.</p>

  <h3>Wait, that's awesome.  But do I have to order the entire case-pack?</h3>
  <p>We're set up to ship in case-packs to keep your shipping cost as low as possible, as well as to prevent damage to your items.</p>

  <h3>Why can't I break case-pack sizes on glassware?</h3>
  <p>Sadly, glass will try to break in transit even when it's carefully packed.  So we ship in inner cartons to reduce that breakage.  We don't want you to receive a smashed wine glass with your order, and we're guessiong you don't want that either.  Food and bags also fare poorly in shipping outside of their case-packs.</p>

  <h3>What does "bulk" mean?</h3>
  <p>Bulk doesn't mean a large volume: bulk products are simply shipped without any sort of retail packaging like boxes or blister cards.  These items generally just come with a barcode sticker or hangtag.</p>

  <h3>I love this product!  What's it made of?</h3>
  <p>Materials are listed on every product's page on the website.  If for some reason a material isn't noted or if you'd like more specifics, you need only ask.</p>
  
  <h3>How do I edit my cart?</h3>
  <p>It's easy!  Click on the cart button on the top right of the page and select "View Cart." You'll have multiple options, including editing</p>
 
  <h3>I need my order, like, now.  How soon can you send it?</h3>
  <p>Place your order before 3pm Pacific Time and we'll ship it the same day from beautiful Seattle, Washington.  Boom.  And everything placed after 3pm will ship first thing in the morning.</p>
 
  <h3>How long will my order take to get here?</h3>
  <p>Depends where "here" is.  The majority of the Pacific Northwest will receive their order the next day, most of the Southwest will receive their order in two business days, the Midwest in three to four business days, and the Eastern Seaboardd in five business days.  Naturally, inclement weather and other circumstances beyond our control can delay shipping.  You can check out estimates specific to your zip code with <a href="http://www.ups.com/maps/results">this map</a> provided by UPS, which we use for most of our shipments (note that we ship from zip code 98057).  We're also happy to provide tracking for any order - just give us a call!</p>
  
  <h3>How much will my shipping cost</h3>
  <p>The cost of shipping for everything in your cart will be calculated at checkout using a standard volume-based system.  We maintain fantastic deals with all of our carriers, and we price-check every one of them to select the cheapest option for each individual order.  Then we pass that exact cost on without any handling fees or upcharges whatsoever - in short, you pay exactly what we pay.  If you have questions, please don't hesitate to ask.</p>
 
  <h3>Why isn't my invoice included in my shipment?</h3>
  <p>Hmm, it definitely should be.  If your invoice somehow managed to dodge being shipped with your order, just let us know and we'll send a new one straight away.</p>
  
  <h3>When will a backordered item be back in stock?</h3>
  <p>Any product that is backordered will have its in-stock date noted on its product page on the website.  As always, we're happy to help with specific product questions via <a href="https://a3.websitealive.com/1297/Operator/Guest/gDefault_v2.asp?cframe=offline&groupid=1297&websiteid=0&departmentid=1581&sessionid_=&skin_id=1461&iniframe=&ppc_id=&loginname=&loginnamelast=&loginemail=&loginphone=&loginquestion=&dl=http%3A%2F%2Ftf.production.na1.netsuitestaging.com%2FAssorted-Wine-Stoppers&offline_input0_value=&offline_input1_value=&offline_input2_value=&offline_input3_value=">chat</a>, phone or <a href="mailto:info@truefabrications.com">email</a> - let us know what you need!</p>
